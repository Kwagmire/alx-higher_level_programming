How to Use 5-text_indentation.py
================================

This module defines a text-indentation function ``text_indentation()``.

Usage
=====

Text is printed with two new lines after each of the characters ``.``, ``?``,
and ``:``.

::

	>>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation
	>>> text_indentation("Hello?")
	Hello?
	<BLANKLINE>

No spaces are printed at the beginning of a line and at the end..

::

	>>> text_indentation("    Woah now.    This is messy.   ")
	Woah now.
	<BLANKLINE>
	This is messy.
	<BLANKLINE>

New lines are only printed for the characters ``.``, ``?``, and ``:`` -
text not ending with one of these characters is not ended with a new line.

::

	>>> text_indentation("No ending period, what bad grammar")
	No ending period, what bad grammar

New lines within a string are printed as normal.

::

	>>> text_indentation("Let's print a new-line! Here goes:\nPrinted.")
	Let's print a new-line! Here goes:
	<BLANKLINE>
	<BLANKLINE>
	Printed.
	<BLANKLINE>

Invalid Text
============

The paramter ``text`` must be a string. Otherwise, a TypeError is raised.

::

	>>> text_indentation(7)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: text must be a string

``text_indentation()`` must take at least one argument.

::

	>>> text_indentation()
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: text_indentation() missing 1 required positional argument: 'text'
